## Integration
**Swift Package Manager**

To install with swift package manager, add the package to your `Package.swift` file:
```ruby
Import PackageDescription

  let package = Package(
    name: "Your_Project_Name",
    targets: [],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/JustinM1/S3SignerAWS.git", from: "4.0.0")
    ]
  )  
  ```
## Usage

**NOTE ABOUT PAYLOAD:**

Requests can either have a signed payload or an unsigned payload.

* If you know the request will not have a payload, set the Payload property to none. This tells s3 that the signature was created with no payload intended
* If you are not sure what the exact payload will be, set payload property to unsigned. This tells s3 when you made the signature, there was a possibility of a payload but you weren't sure what specific object will be uploaded.
* `Payload` enum:

    ```ruby
    public enum Payload {
      case data(Data)
      case none
      case unsigned
    }
    ```
To begin working with the S3SignerAWS class, initialize an instance similar to example shown below:

```ruby
let s3Signer = S3SignerAWS(accessKey: "YOUR_AWS_PUBLIC_KEY", secretKey: "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY", region: .usStandard_usEast1)  
```
**NOTE -** Hardcoding Secret Keys on client is _not_ recommended for security reasons.

### V4 Authorization Header
For both V4 Authorization Header and Pre-Signed URL, you can add additional headers as needed for your specific use case.

GET

```ruby
do {
  guard let url = URL(string: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketName/testUploadImage.png") else { throw someError }
  let headers = try s3Signer.authHeaderV4(httpMethod: .get, urlString: url.absoluteString, headers: [:], payload: .none)          
  var request = URLRequest(url: url)
  request.httpMethod = HTTPMethod.get.rawValue
  headers.forEach { request.setValue($0.key, forHTTPHeaderField: $0.value) }
      // make network request
    } catch {
      //handle error
    }
  }
  ```
PUT

```ruby
do {
  let bytesObject = try someDataObject.makeBytes()
  guard let url = URL(string: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketName/testUploadImage.png") else { throw someError }
  let headers = try s3Signer.authHeadersV4(httpMethod: .put, urlString: url.absoluteString, headers: [:], payload: .bytes(bytesObject))
  var request = URLRequest(url: url)
  request.httpMethod = HTTPMethod.put.rawValue
  request.httpBody = Data(bytes: bytesObject)
  headers.forEach { request.setValue($0.key, forHTTPHeaderField: $0.value) }
      // make network request
    } catch {
    //handle error
    }
  }
  ```
DELETE

```ruby
do {
  guard let url = URL(string: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketName/testUploadImage.png") else { throw someError }
  let headers = try s3Signer.authHeadersV4(httpMethod: .delete, urlString: url.absoluteString, headers: [:], payload: .none)
  var request = URLRequest(url: url)
  request.httpMethod = HTTPMethod.delete.rawValue
  headers.forEach { request.setValue($0.key, forHTTPHeaderField: $0.value) }
      // make network request
    } catch {
      //handle error
    }
  }
```

### V4 Pre-Signed URL

Similar to the ease of generating authentication headers, to generate a pre-signed url:
```ruby
let presignedURL = signer.presignedURLV4(httpMethod: HTTPMethod, urlString: String, expiration: TimeFromNow, headers: [String: String]) -> String
  ```
